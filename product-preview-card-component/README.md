## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

1. To adapt the website's design to the screen size of the user's device.

```css

@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 481px and (max-width: 620px)) {
    
}

@media only screen and (min width: 621px) {
    
}

```

2. To center the div vertically and horizantally using position and margin property.

```css


  .container {
  position: absolute;
  top:50%;
  left:50%;
  margin: -220px 0 0 -280px;
}

```
